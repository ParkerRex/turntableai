# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
TurntableAI follows the Next.js App Router architecture pattern, which organizes the application using file-system based routing in the `src/app` directory.

## Component Structure
- Currently using the default Next.js page component structure
- Components are defined in TypeScript React (TSX) files

## Design Patterns
- React functional components with hooks
- Server components (Next.js 13+ pattern)
- Client components when needed (to be marked with "use client" directive)

## Data Flow
To be established as the application develops.

## State Management
To be determined based on application needs. Could include:
- React Context API
- Server components for server-side state
- Client-side state using hooks

## API Integration
To be determined as the project develops.

## Routing Strategy
Using Next.js App Router for file-system based routing.

## Performance Considerations
- Using Next.js image optimization
- TypeScript for type safety
- Leveraging Next.js server-side rendering capabilities

## Security Patterns
To be established as authentication and data handling features are implemented.

## Testing Approach
To be defined.
