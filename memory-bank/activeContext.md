# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Initial project setup and documentation
- Establishing memory bank structure to track project development

## Recent Changes
- Created the basic memory bank structure
- Documented the initial project state

## Next Steps
- Define specific product requirements
- Determine application features
- Plan architecture and component structure
- Begin implementing custom functionality beyond the default template

## Active Decisions
- Using Next.js App Router pattern for routing
- Following TypeScript for type safety
- Using TailwindCSS for styling

## Open Questions
- What is the specific purpose of TurntableAI?
- What features need to be implemented?
- What data sources will the application connect to?
- What deployment strategy will be used?

## In-Progress Work
- Setting up project documentation
- Exploring the current codebase

## Blockers
- Need more specific product requirements
- Need to define application features

## Notes
The project is currently a standard Next.js template with no custom functionality implemented yet. Further direction is needed to determine the specific purpose and features of the application.
