# TurntableAI Project Rules

## Project Structure
- Next.js App Router pattern is used for routing
- Source code is in the `src` directory
- App routes and pages are in `src/app`
- Public assets are in the `public` directory

## Coding Standards
- TypeScript is used for all code files
- React components use functional component pattern with hooks
- TailwindCSS is used for styling
- Default component exports are preferred

## Development Workflow
- Development server uses Turbopack for faster builds (`npm run dev`)
- ESLint is used for code quality checks (`npm run lint`)
- Build process uses Next.js build system (`npm run build`)

## File Naming
- React components use PascalCase (e.g., `ComponentName.tsx`)
- Utility files use camelCase (e.g., `utilityName.ts`)
- Next.js special files follow Next.js conventions (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, etc.)

## Memory Bank Maintenance
- Memory bank files should be updated when significant changes are made to the project
- `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` should be updated most frequently
- All memory bank files should be reviewed when significant architectural changes are made
